# Aeronautic occurrences in Brazil
In this presentation I will be using open data that were available by CENIPA - Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes aeronáuticos - or Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center. You may have access to newer data by visiting the <a href='http://dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira'>Brazilian Open Data's official website</a>, or just clicking in the following links in order to download the datasets:

<a href='https://github.com/paulozip/aeronautic-occurrences/blob/master/dataset/occurrences.csv'>Occurrences.csv</a>: it contains the data of each occurrence recorded in the last 10 years. Occurrence ID, Date, Occurrence cause and Location are found in this dataset.

<a href='https://github.com/paulozip/aeronautic-occurrences/blob/master/dataset/aircrafts.csv'>Aircraft.csv</a>: CSV file containing information about aircrafts envolved in registered occurrence. Here you will find the following type of data: Aircraft Model, Aircraft Type, Manufacturer, Fatalities, and so on.

# Questions to answer
1. What are the major occurrence causes and, eventually, airplane falling?
2. How it has progressed in the last years? Was there fewer or more occurrences?
3. Which states did register more occurrences?
4. What kind of aircraft has shown more problems? Airplanes, jets, gliders?
5. What are the manufacturers that has shown more faults?
6. Is more likely the aircraft fail during the takeoff or during the landing? Is the cruise phase a risk moment?
7. Do regular trips have more occurrences than chartered flights?
8. How many fatalities have we registered in the last 10 years?

# Requirements
